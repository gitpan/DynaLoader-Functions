    that require it

version 0.001; 2012-02-07

  * duplicate small functions from Params::Classify and Module::Runtime,
    rather than importing from those modules, to avoid circular dependency
    problems (affecting both installation and runtime)

  * load modules Carp and DynaLoader lazily, to avoid excessive startup
    delay and potential circular dependencies

  * make the module used for testing more amenable to picky compilation
    toolchains

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore
